            <h2>The Backgroundstory</h2>
        </div>
        <p>2020 in a nuclear power plant near Dallas. The heads of the nuclear power plant have noticed a leak at the power station. The leak has polluted the lake, from which the surrounding towns draw their water. In order to prevent a scandal, the head of the nuclear power plant hides the accident and no one is informed of the lake's contamination.
        </p>
        <p>2025 in a corn field near Dallas.
            The farmer Michael Montgomery takes care of his maize field day in day out, but the corn just does not want to grow. Like every evening, he waters his field and hopes for sprouts.
            The next day, farmer Montgomery gets up and can’t believe his eyes. Magically his corn has grown and is ready to be harvested. He is so happy and prepares everything for harvest. As he stomps through the corn field he suddenly hears a hiss. He does not think anything of it, and continues through his field until he hears it again. Then he notices that the whole maize field is hissing and moving.
            The corns jump out of the corncob one after another and fall to the ground. But they don’t stay there. It pops and * plop * the corns have big, round eyes. They straighten up and begin to move by themselves.
            Farmer Montgomery is fully panicked and runs back to his barn. He loses a pack of matches, which he always has in the pocket of his dungarees.
            The corns grab the matches and begin to chase each other with them. Small explosions are heard from the corn field, because the corns attack each other with the matches - until they become popcorn. The popcorn panic begins.

            <p>The game „Popcorn Panic“ was created as part of a university project from the interdisciplinary course of study „Online Media“ of the Duale Hochschule Baden Württemberg Mosbach. The student group was able to chose their own topic, where they could show all the learned skills from their three years of study. From the first concept to the finished idea of the game the topics „UX“, „Game Development Frontend and Backend“, „Visual Design“, „Animation with blender“ where met as well as the agile project management method „Scrum“. </p>
